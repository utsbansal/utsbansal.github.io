        para1: "Living in Buffalo, NY, the biggest attraction for one would be the Niagara Falls. Everything about the Niagara Falls is amazing. It is beautiful, it is located right in the middle of two countries and it has locations for trekking & picnicing. When one visits the Niagara Falls, the expectations are pretty high. You expect the falls to be huge. And honestly, they are even bigger than you could think of. My uncle, aunt and their children made the experience so much more enjoyable. We trekked to the whirlpool park and back. The nature around you is a treat to your eyes. Also makes you realize the power that it possesses.",
        para2: "There are multiple activities that you can do at the falls. One of them is called \"Maid of the Mist\". In this, you get to go very close to the falls in a ferry. They give you a raincoat to wear because, no surprises, you get wet. The falls look even more mesmerizing from down there. Also, this actvity is offered from Canada's side as well. While passing by the Canadian ferry, a lot of hand waving occurs because people from either side are excited to see each other. Definitely one of the activities that you must do when you visit. It is definitely a place where I would be visiting quite frequently just because how amazing it is."

        para1: "After a tiring and frustrating lockdown, having to study at home, the world finally started to open. Me and all my friends new it was an opportunity for us to have one last hurrah before passing out from the college. The plans to visit Kasol, Manikaran and Kheerganga started to brew. The excitement of doing a 12 Km long trek motivated everyone to join in. We started our journey at 10 PM from Ambala and headed directly towards Manikaran. The night was spent talking, sleeping and stopping to stretch our legs every now and then. At around 8 AM we reached Manikaran Sahib Gurudwara, a Gurudwara famous for its hot springs. After having breakfast we decided to leave early because today was also going to be the big day of treking to the Kheerganga camp. The trek started at 12 PM and it took us almost 5 hours to reach to the top. The trek consisted of walking through the forests, crossing waterfalls and tackling rough terrain to finally reach the place where we could spend the night. Everyone was exhausted when we reaached, but this exhaustion meant we had actually done something incredible.",
        para2: "The next day we trekked down and took a different route, through Tosh village. The moment we reached the bottom, we had this sense of satisfaction that is hard to describe. Overall the experience was unforgettable, thanks to everyone around. From there, we headed straight to Manikaran again, had lunch and went to Kasol for the final night. Kasol was the only place where we stayed in a comfortable hotel on the entire trip. After resting for a while, we decided to head to the market and explore. While returning, we had dinner at a dhaba. The night at the hotel was spent dancing and enjoying together. We all new that this could very well be our final outing together as a group. The next morning we started the arduous(because it was soooo looooooong) journey of heading back to Ambala. As we sat in the taxi waiting to reach Ambala, we all relished our time together and thanked each other to come along. Looking forward to more such trekking experiences..."

        para1: "Being a member of Youth Hostel Association of India certainly has its perks. One of them being getting the opportunity to travel to all sorts of different places in or outside India. As soon as I received the pamphlet about the program \"Discover Qatar in 144 Hours\", my mother convinced me to enroll in it and that's what I did. The program was scheduled from 22<sup>nd</sup> September 2019 to 27<sup>th</sup> September 2019. It was organised by the Qatar Youth Hostels and we were the delegates from India that were going to visit. In this time we were shown countless places in Qatar. Some of them being :-<br><ul><li>Qatar National Library</li><li>Sheikh Faisal Museum</li><li>Barzan Towers</li><li>Katara Cultural Village</li><li>Qatar National Museum</li><li>Al Janoub Stadium and many more...</li></ul>",
        para2: "I am so thankful to the Qatar Youth Hostels for this opportunity. Also I feel very lucky to have met Aman, Badonbok, Sameep, Nishad, Sindura, Ankita, Amrutha, Radhika and Anu. The five days that all of us had spent together can never be forgotten. It was so cool to witness something for the first time together. Hopefully more of such programs take place and these expeditions never end."

        para1: "A little background on this trip, my aunt lives in Australia, and she came to India after almost 5 years this time. My maternal grandfather decided that the best way we will enjoy our time with her is to go on a vacation. As he is from Rajasthan, the destinations for the trip were decided as Jodhpur & Jaisalmer. Our first destination was Jodhpur and then we went to Jaisalmer. In the whole trip we saw Umed Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur Fort, Jaisalmer Fort and large deserts. As we were in Rajasthan, camel ride and offroading on the sand dunes in a 4X4 was a must.",
        para2: "The camp where we stayed at in Jaisalmer also had a traditional program every night where they perform typical Rajasthani singing and dancing. It was definitely a great time to just sit and watch the live performance. As we were travelling in the desert one day, we also got a chance to do paragliding. To be up so high and the only thing you can see around you is desert, is a surreal experience. Again, the credits for this trip go to my maternal grandfather and my aunt. It is their dedication that we were able to experience all of this together."

        para1: "I honestly never imagined that I would get a chance this early to visit an island in my life. The year was 2018. Not only it was the first time that I would go to an island, but it was also going to be the first time I would sit inside an airplane. The excitement was real. The background here is that my maternal grandfather wanted to go on a vacation with all his extended family. He had decided that it was going to be something special. That is when he proposed this idea to us and my aunt's family in Jaipur. Although it was going to be a difficult task to leave your work and go on a trip for a week, but everybody decided to manage. I have never seen my father not work for such a long period of time. Running a business means that you are working all the time. There are no holidays and no closing hours. As he thought that he will try to run the operations from there only, it didn't work out.",
        para2: "The first thing we instantly realised when we reached there was that... \"THERE WAS NO MOBILE RECEPTION!!\". Ok, no is a little exaggeration but it was really bad. The only signal that any mobile was able to catch was BSNL 2G. That too in limited places. We knew that this was going to be the real holiday, absolutely no connection with the outside world. We visited three Islands:-<ul><li>Port Blair</li><li>Havelock Island</li><li>Neil Island</li></ul>Port Blair was the only place where we got Wifi in the hotel that too was slower than 2G. My father who receives atleast 100 calls a day had no call to answer. We travelled from island to island in a cruise. The only reason we were able to enjoy all this is because of my Nanaji and Naniji. The whole credit for this trip goes to them."

        para1: "Dharamshala & Mcleodganj, the former I knew only because of having the highest cricket stadium  ever built and the latter I knew because of the home of His Highness Dalai Lama. It was our 2<sup>nd</sup> semester of engineering. We were only thinking about one thing, a trip. Fortunately, our teachers were amazing and supported this idea from the starting. Dharamshala & Mcleodganj are popular tourist places so these were definitely going to be on the list. After all the formal processes, we were heading off to these places at the end of March. Ambala to Dharamshala is approximately 270 kilometers, doesn't seem that far away. Although one thing to remember is that we are talking about hills, where you won't be going at 70 or 80 kilometers an hour. We knew it would take time to get there. So we decided to take our time and also visit Chamunda Devi temple and stay the night there.",
        para2: "On the subsequent days we visited Dharamshala and Mcleodganj. These places were beautiful, no doubt, but not more beautiful than the memories me and my friends made together. The point of these trips is that we get to spend time with the people we appreciate. We visited the cricket stadium as well. My first time inside one even though I am an avid follower of the game. As I look back to this trip, I relish the dumbcharades, the deafening punjabi songs and the laughs we had in those 3 days. A big thanks to Richa Mam, Charu Mam and Vandana Mam for making all this possible. These people were not just our teachers but the greatest companions."
