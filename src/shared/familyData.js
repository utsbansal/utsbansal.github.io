He did his Masters in Mechanical Engineering from Arizona State University and Doctorate from Georgia Institute of Technology. He is heavily involved in social service and makes me want to get capable enough to do it as well. His courage is unparalleled. He is a hobby pilot and at the age of 68, he became the first person of Indian origin to fly solo around the world in his single engine plane. If that doesn\'t motivate you I don\'t know what will.',

As you might have figured out, he is extremely knowledgable in the field of education. He did his Doctorate in Chemistry from CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar. Many people from his family as well as ours have taken guidance from him and I still do it all the time. Apart from that he is a proud Haryanvi and always has ways to cheer you up if you are feeling low. If you ever want to realise the value of education, just talk to him and you will have an entirely different perspective of everything.',
