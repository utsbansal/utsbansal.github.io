way to explore U.S. is to do a road trip and visit some of its national parks. And now that I have gone on one, I can definitely tell its true. I got a wonderful opportunity to drive from Buffalo, New York to Gatlinburg, Tennessee and back. It is about 700 miles or 1100 kilometres one way, which can be translated to approximately 12 hour drive. The best part about road tripping is that you get to break your journey into parts and explore the cities that you pass through as well. On our way there we saw the city of Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), Beckley (West Virginia) and Asheville (North Carolina), before finally reaching Gatlinburg. Pittsburgh is a big and popular city out of the lot. It is a beautiful city as well with the right blend of man-made and natural beauty all around. Beckeley is popular for its coal mining operations which we got to see while visiting a coal mine there.

It is a perfect tourist spot for people to come and live the vacation they have dreamed off. If you want to just be there and relax, you can do that. If you are an outgoing person who wants to try different activities, Gatlinburg will not disappoint. There is so much to do in the city, from full fletched amusement parks to small unique experiences. No matter what kind of person you are, you will find something to do in Gatlinburg, and it will be fun and exciting. The national park is famous for its tall mountains and bears. The clouds near the mountain tops give the illusion of smoke, hence the name. Unfortunately, we did not have a proper bear siting (apart from one time, which lasted for like 5 seconds), but we did get to see the forest and the preserved area nearby. They have also preserved houses from some of the first inhabitors in the area, which you get to see and wonder how people lived centuries ago. While coming back we saw the Kentucky horse park in Lexington (Kentucky) and stayed a night in Columbus (Ohio). All in all, what a wonderful week it was. Looking forward to more such experiences!\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 1,\n        place: \"Lancaster, Pennsylvania\",\n        link: \"lancaster\",\n        description: \"In the city of people living in the old ways.\",\n        image1: \"/assets/images/lancaster.jpeg\",\n        image2: \"/assets/images/lancaster1.jpeg\",\n        image3: \"/assets/images/lancaster2.jpeg\",\n        heading: \"Lancaster, Pennsylvania\",\n        para1: \"Lancaster is a very interesting city.

The Amish Community came to Lancaster in the 1700s and since then have lived there and formed one of largest Amish Communities in America. These people are traditionalists who like to do things the old way. Like using a horse cart instead of a car. Lancaster has good tourism spots if you want to see the way these people live. Secondly, the railroads are popular because they are believed to be one of the earliest railroads that were made for the transport of goods in Eastern America. Even though there are historical sights to visit, the city has modern attractions as well. Amusement park, trampoline park, natural parks, you name it and the city has it.

Being surrounded by kids all day long who just want to have fun and enjoy the present is a perk. Sometimes you run after them, sometimes you run from them, but the important part is that you always run with them and that is what they want.

After resting for a while, we decided to head to the market and explore. While returning, we had dinner at a dhaba. The night at the hotel was spent dancing and enjoying together. We all new that this could very well be our final outing together as a group. The next morning we started the arduous(because it was soooo looooooong) journey of heading back to Ambala.

reader, I, Utkarsh Bansal, am glad that you have visited my website. I was born and brought up in a middle class family in Ambala Cantt, \n                            Haryana. With the nature of my father's work in designing, printing and packaging, I was introduced to computers at a very early stage in my \n                            life. Playing video games on the internet and making masterpieces in MS-Paint were a great pass time for me. Giving this much time to computers \n                            got me interested in studying about computers and today I am studying Computer Science Engineering.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            With my father's family belonging to Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh and my mother's family belonging to Kota, Rajasthan. I have travelled for countless hours in \n                            my life. No surprise I love travelling. Hills and mountains are my favourite destinations to go to. Although I would go to any place if I get a chance.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            To see more of my professional qualifications, you can check
